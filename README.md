### Explanation
The process of developing a React application usually begins with coding in a local development environment.
When you initialize a project using a tool such as create-react-app, an environment is built with the settings necessary for development preset.
During development, you can start a local development server using the **npm start** command to preview and hot-reload changes in real time.
When development is complete and you are ready to deploy to the production environment, use the **npm run build** command to generate a production build.
